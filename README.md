# Personas_Clustering_technqiue

**1. Project Objective**
The objective of this project is to develop a persona segmentation model for prospective Master's students. By leveraging clustering and machine learning techniques, the model segments students into distinct personas based on factors influencing their enrollment decisions. This segmentation aids in understanding diverse student needs and preferences, enabling more personalized marketing and communication strategies.

**2. Dataset**
The dataset includes various attributes such as intent to enroll, English proficiency scores, event participation, GPAs, and standardized test scores from potential students. Data preprocessing involved cleaning, normalization, and reducing dimensionality to focus on the most impactful features.

**3. Approach**

The methodology encompasses several phases:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Initial cleaning to handle missing data and normalization to scale feature values.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying key features that significantly influence student profiles and enrollment decisions.
- **Clustering for Persona Creation**: Applying clustering algorithms to categorize students into personas based on similarity in characteristics.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using a RandomForest classifier to predict the likelihood of enrollment for each persona, enhancing the ability to target specific groups effectively.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Ranking features by their influence on the model to identify which attributes most significantly affect enrollment likelihood and persona characteristics.

**4. Results**

The clustering effectively identified distinct personas among the student candidates, revealing unique clusters with specific enrollment behaviors and preferences. The predictive model demonstrated good accuracy in forecasting student enrollment decisions, underpinned by a robust analysis of feature importance. These insights are crucial for crafting tailored outreach and engagement strategies that resonate with each student persona.
